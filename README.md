Purpose: Multiple high schools in the Bethlehem community suffer from low graduation rates. Put simply, more students than in the average high school in Bethlehem school district tend to lose interest in their academic pursuits. Through Lehigh Valley's Association of Independent Colleges, students can participate in community events with industry experts that can improve teaching skills, expand knowledge in specific disciplines, or teach about how to take on a leadership role. How can we raise student awareness for these school districts, and fortify LVAIC to serve as an even more powerful and engaging platform?

Approach: We developed a platform allowing local Bethlehem High School admins to select days on calendars, and invite students to participate in 1:1 mentoring/advisory sessions with college students. High school admins submit a request that stays pending until a College Admin chooses to approve or deny a request. When multiple high school admins select requests that fall on the same time slot, the request that the college Admin approves gets scheduled across both calendars, and all other requests get rejected so High school admins can reselect another time slot.
